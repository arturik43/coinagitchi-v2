# Coinagitchi v2.1

This repository contains a placeholder implementation of the Coinagitchi project. It includes a simple HTML page with buttons to simulate actions (Feed, Sleep, Train) that affect the experience points (XP) and level of a virtual pet. The NFT mint functionality is not implemented yet.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML page.
- `xp-system.js`: JavaScript file managing the XP system and user interactions.
- `mint.js`: JavaScript file for NFT minting (placeholder).
- `metadata.json`: Example metadata for a Coinagitchi NFT.

Future versions will implement full Web3 functionality, including Firebase integration, NFT minting on the Mumbai testnet, and more.
